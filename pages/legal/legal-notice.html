                    <p>
                        As a service provider we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to 
                        general laws pursuant to § 7 para. 1 TMG. However, pursuant to §§ 8 to 10 TMG we are not 
                        under obligation to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate 
                        circumstances pointing to illegal activity.

                    <p>
                        Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. 
                        However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which knowledge 
                        of a specific infringement is obtained. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove 
                        this content immediately.

                    <p>
                        Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties on whose contents we have no 
                        influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective 
                        provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages.

                        The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal 
                        contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the 
                        contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. 
                        Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.
