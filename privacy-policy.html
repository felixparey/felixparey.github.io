    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
        <strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us, but we do not require identifiable information like name or email to use our core Services.</em>
    </p>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
        We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us *if* you contact us directly (e.g., via email) or express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services. We do not require registration or collection of direct identifiers like name or email address to use our mobile application.
    </p>

    <h3 data-custom-class="heading_2">Information automatically collected</h3>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
        <strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>Diagnostic and usage data is collected automatically *if* you opt-in via your device settings. This data helps us improve our app.</em>
    </p>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
        We automatically collect certain information when you use the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information unless you provide it separately, e.g., via email) but includes device, diagnostic, and usage information.
    </p>
     <p data-custom-class="body_text">
         Specifically, if you choose to enable sharing of diagnostic and usage data through your mobile device's operating system settings (e.g., Apple's "Share iPhone & Watch Analytics" or similar options), we may receive information related to your use of our application(s). This data collection is facilitated by the platform provider (e.g., Apple) based on your consent given through the device settings. The information we may receive includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li data-custom-class="body_text">
            <strong>Log and Usage Data:</strong> Service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information. This can include details about your activity in the Services (e.g., session duration, features used, performance metrics, date/time stamps), device event information (system activity, error reports/crash dumps, hardware settings), IP address (which may be anonymized or truncated by the platform provider), device identifiers, operating system, and browser/device characteristics.
        </li>
        <li data-custom-class="body_text">
             <strong>Device Data:</strong> Information about the device you use, such as device model, operating system version, device identifiers, device settings, application identification numbers, and potentially mobile carrier or network information associated with crash reports.
        </li>
        </ul>
     <p data-custom-class="body_text">
         This diagnostic and usage information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, to identify and fix bugs, understand usage patterns, improve app performance and features, and for internal analytics and reporting purposes.

    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
        <em><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent (including consent provided via OS settings for diagnostics), to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests (like app improvement).</em>

        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li data-custom-class="body_text">
            <strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. This includes consent you may provide through your device's operating system settings to share diagnostic and usage data. You can withdraw your consent at any time, typically through those same OS settings or by contacting us (for consent given directly to us). Learn more about <a data-custom-class="link" href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent</a>.
        </li>
         <li data-custom-class="body_text">
             <strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process diagnostic and usage data based on legitimate interests to analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them, ensure stability, and diagnose problems.
         </li>
         <li data-custom-class="body_text">
            <strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
        </li>
         <li data-custom-class="body_text">
            <strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

    </p>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
        In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example (list remains the same as previous version):

    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). For diagnostic and usage data collected via OS opt-in, we retain it only as long as needed for analysis, troubleshooting, and app improvement purposes, often in aggregated or anonymized form.
    </p>
    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

    <p data-custom-class="body_text">
        In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information (e.g., processing based on legitimate interests). You can make such a request concerning information we hold by contacting us using the details in the section "<a data-custom-class="link" href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>" below.

        If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

For any consent provided directly to us (e.g., if you contacted us), you can withdraw that consent by contacting us using the details in the section "<a data-custom-class="link" href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>" below.

As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
